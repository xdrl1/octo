# Xilinx Kria KV260

The AMD Xilinx&reg; Kria&trade; KV260 Vision AI Starter Kit (hereinafter to be referred as KV260) is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) evaluation platform particularly designed for computer vision tasks, consisted of a Zynq&trade; UltraScale+&trade; MPSoC based K26 system-on-module (SOM), a carrier card providing connections to peripheral equipments, and an air cooling radiator. Tutorials in this course will use KV260 as target boards.

## Specifications

> The detailed data sheet of KV260 could be found [here](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ds986-kv260-starter-kit/Summary).

The core of KV260 is a Zynq&trade; UltraScale+&trade; MPSoC based K26 SOM, containing quad-core Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-A53 MPCore&trade; (up to 1.3GHz) and dual-core Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-R5F MPCore (up to 533MHz). Despite these obscure names, their low clock frequencies partly reflect their poor performances. A more intuitive example is Qualcomm&reg; Snapdragon&trade; 625 consisted of 8x Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-A53 cores, which is usually used by midrange smartphones back to 2016. Generally, computational capabilities of these edge devices are largely limited by constrained power supply due to battery life concerns or save costs. Therefore, deploying AI tasks involving enormous amount of computation onto edge devices is non-trivial, revealing the motivation of this course.

## Setup

This section will introduce how to setup a KV260 board from scratch. In most cases, both KV260 and its [basic accessory pack](https://www.xilinx.com/products/som/kria/kv260-vision-starter-kit/basic-accessory-pack.html) are sold in a bundle (as the power supply (12V, 3A) and a compatible camera module (AR1335) are within the *basic accessory pack*).

### Recommended Accessories

Except for KV260, a camera module and a power cable, following accessories are also essential for setup.

1. keyboard and mouse (USB/2.4G wireless).

2. fast MicroSD card (16GB or above, 64GB recommended, [an example](https://www.westerndigital.com/de-de/products/memory-cards/sandisk-extreme-pro-uhs-i-microsd#SDSQXCU-064G-GN6MA)). Note that a MicroSD card adapter may also be needed for flashing OS via PC.

3. HDMI or DP cable connecting KV260 and a monitor.

4. Ethernet cable for network connection.

5. (optional) a USB camera if AR1335 cannot meet certain requirements (Logitech BRIO is [recommended by Xilinx](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis-AI/3.0/html/docs/quickstart/mpsoc.html#setup-the-target), as it can *stream RAW video at higher resolutions than most low-cost webcams*).

6. (optional) Micro USB cable if UART communication preferred.

7. (optional) 3D-printed stand ([file](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4886199), [discussion](https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E00006hpR6wSAE/kv260-starter-kit-3d-printed-holder?language=en_US))

### OS Installation

There are two options of OS that can be installed on KV260:

1. **Ubuntu Desktop 22.04/20.04 LTS**:
    - the same GUI as normal Ubuntu.
    - more manual settings required.

2. **PetaLinux**:
    - fundamental GUI.
    - with out-of-the-box Vitis AI (DPU) support, thus easier to use.

Installation steps for each OS are given below.

#### Ubuntu

There are two options provided: 22.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS. Here, 22.04 LTS is chosen as an example, as the latest boot firmware only supports this version. On your own PC,

1. Download the official Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 LTS for Kria&trade; K26 SOMs [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/amd).
2. Install an image flashing tool (e.g., [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), [rufus](https://rufus.ie/)).
3. Insert an microSD card into your PC (or connected by a microSD card writer)
4. Follow the instructions of the image flashing tool to flash the Ubuntu image onto your microSD card.
5. Wait until the flashing process finishes successfully, remove the microSD card from your PC and insert it into the microSD slot on KV260.

#### PetaLinux

Basically the same as the steps for Ubuntu images. The only difference is the OS image. Download the official PetaLinux [here](https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/design-license-xef.html?filename=xilinx-kv260-dpu-v2022.2-v3.0.0.img.gz). Note that an AMD account and a questionnaire to fill out are required here.

After the microSD card flashed with desired OS is ready, connect everything in order as shown below to boot.

### Firmware Update

Typically, KV260 is not sold with the latest version of boot firmware (FW), which would prevent users from using the latest Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 and remain some bugs unfixed. Hence, it is necessary to check the boot FW version after booting.
